I will be uploading simple Tasks in PDF and their solution in bash language. With best possible logic.

Q1.Write a Script that inputs a directory name (or path) from user and creates a
file in it. Check for invalid path and write permissions of the directory.

Q2. Write a shell script that take a number as argument and print its table.
Check for errors in inputs such as no command line argument etc.

Q3. Write a shell script that will add three integer numbers, which are supplied by
the user and then find their average.

Q4. The marks obtained by a student in 3 different subjects are input through
the keyboard. The student gets a division as per the following rules:
Average above or equal to 60 - First division
Average between 50 and 59 - Second division
Average between 40 and 49 - Third division Average
less than 40 - Fail
Write a shell script to calculate the division obtained by the student.
